SO ELLA
CONGRATULATIONS IF YOU GOT TO THIS POINT. ALL I TOLD YOU WAS THAT RIDDLE #3 HAD ARRIVED AND WISHED YOU GOOD LUCK. MAYBE YOU'LL GET ONE HINT. 

FIRST THINGS FIRST... I JUST SENT YOU A PHISHING EMAIL AND YOU CLICKED ON IT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN IF SOMEBODY IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO HACK YOU.

NOW BACK TO WHY WE'RE PLAYING THIS LITTLE GAME. WHERE AM I BRINGING YOU?

IF YOU GUESS CORRECTLY (YOU HAVE TO GET TO THIS POINT), I WILL TELL YOU AND SEND YOU THE REAL TICKET CONFIRMATION. I SWEAR I WON'T LIE TO YOU IF YOU GET IT CORRECT. 

YOU GET 3 GUESSES.

IF YOU FAIL, THE GAMES WILL CONTINUE.

I WON'T BE ASKING YOU IF YOU'VE COMPLETED IT (UNLESS YOU TAKE TOO LONG). I WILL KNOW IF YOU ARE CORRECT WHEN YOU TEXT ME YOUR GUESS OF WHERE WE ARE GOING. 

I LOVE YOU SO MUCH AND CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT. YOU ARE GENUINELY MY FAVORITE PERSON IN THE WORLD.
